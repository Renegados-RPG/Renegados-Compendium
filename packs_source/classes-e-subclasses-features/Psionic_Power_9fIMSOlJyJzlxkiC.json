      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p><i>3rd-level Soulknife feature</i></p><p>You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. This energy is represented by your Psionic Energy dice, which are each a [[/r d6]]. You have a number of these dice equal to twice your proficiency bonus, and they fuel various psionic powers you have, which are detailed below.</p><p>Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy die they use, as specified in a power's description, and you can't use a power if it requires you to use a die when your dice are all expended. You regain all your expended Psionic Energy dice when you finish a long rest. In addition, as a bonus action, you can regain one expended Psionic Energy die, but you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>When you reach certain levels in this class, the size of your Psionic Energy dice increases: at 5th level ([[/r d8]]), 11th level ([[/r d10]]), and 17th level ([[/r d12]]).</p><p>The powers below use your Psionic Energy dice.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Psi-Bolstered Knack\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p63\">Psi-Bolstered Knack</span></h3> <p>When your nonpsionic training fails you, your psionic power can help: if you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. You expend the die only if the roll succeeds.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Psychic Whispers\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p63\">Psychic Whispers</span></h3> <p>You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others-perfect for quiet infiltration. As an action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically with you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can't use this telepathy if it can't speak any languages, and a creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required). You and the creature don't need to speak a common language to understand each other.</p><p>The first time you use this power after each long rest, you don't expend the Psionic Energy die. All other times you use the power, you expend the die.</p></div></div></div>",
