      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><p>Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.</p><p>In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Training in War and Song (Bladesinging)\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p76\">Training in War and Song (Bladesinging)</span></h3> <p>When you adopt this tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with light armor, and you gain proficiency with one type of one-handed melee weapon of your choice.</p><p>You also gain proficiency in the &amp;Reference[skill=Performance] skill if you don't already have it.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bladesong\" data-source=\"TCE\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, p76\">Bladesong</span></h3> <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can invoke a secret elven magic called the Bladesong, provided you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are &amp;Reference[condition=incapacitated], if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).</p><p>While your bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You have advantage on Dexterity (&amp;Reference[skill=Acrobatics]) checks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throws you make to maintain @status[concentration] on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li></ul><p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bladesinger Styles\" data-source=\"TCE\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"3\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bladesinger Styles</h4><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link rd__title-link--inset\"><span class=\"help-subtle\" title=\"Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything\">TCE</span> <span title=\"Page 76\">p76</span></span></span></span><p>From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesinging has been tied to the sword, more specifically the longsword. Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those students who survived.</p><p>Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cat\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cat.</span></span> Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling dance of defense from which they launch into sudden leaps and attacks.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Bird\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bird.</span></span> Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, they use weapons not typically favored by elves. Eagle-style bladesingers use small handaxes, and many maneuvers in the style focus on fluid ways to throw the weapon and draw a new one. Raven style uses a war pick, and spells associated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Snake\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"6\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Snake.</span></span> Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison and disease favored by the style.</p></div></div></div>",
