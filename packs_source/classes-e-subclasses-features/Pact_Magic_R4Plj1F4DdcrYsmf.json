See <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,10\">chapter 10</a> for the general rules of spellcasting and <a href=\"https://5e.tools/book.html#PHB,11\">chapter 11</a> for the <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:warlock=1\">warlock spell list</a>.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Cantrips\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cantrips.</span></span> You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spell Slots\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spell Slots.</span></span> The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your <a href=\"https://5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:warlock=1\">warlock spells</a> of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.YLT6fV68ZctkMTEF], you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher.</span></span> At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spellcasting Ability\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Ability.</span></span> Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><div class=\"rd__wrp-centered-ability\"><b>Spell save DC</b> = 8 + Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus</div><div class=\"rd__wrp-centered-ability\"><b>Spell attack modifier</b> = Charisma modifier + Proficiency Bonus</div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Spellcasting Focus\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"5\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Spellcasting Focus.</span></span> You can use an @item[arcane focus|phb] as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.</p></div></div>",
