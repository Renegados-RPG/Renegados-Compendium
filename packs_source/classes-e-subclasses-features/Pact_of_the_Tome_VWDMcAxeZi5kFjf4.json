When you gain this feature, choose three <a href=\"https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1\">cantrips</a> from any class's spell list. The cantrips do not need to be from the same spell list. While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your number of cantrips known. Any cantrip you cast with this feature is considered a warlock cantrip for you. If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div></div>",
