When you slay a humanoid, you can cause its spirit to rise from its corpse as a @creature[specter], the statistics for which are in the Monster Manual. When the specter appears, it gains temporary hit points equal to half your warlock level. Roll initiative for the specter, which has its own turns. It obeys your verbal commands, and it gains a special bonus to its attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of +0).</p><p>The specter remains in your service until the end of your next long rest, at which point it vanishes to the afterlife.</p><p>Once you bind a specter with this feature, you can't use the feature again until you finish a long rest.</p></div>",
