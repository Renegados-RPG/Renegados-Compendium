Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists—including many gnome wizards—are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Illusion Savant\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p118\">Illusion Savant</span></h3> <p>Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an illusion spell into your spellbook is halved.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Improved Minor Illusion\" data-source=\"PHB\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner help-subtle\" title=\"Source: Player’s Handbook (2014), p118\">Improved Minor Illusion</span></h3> <p>When you choose this school at 2nd level, you learn the @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.H0rSowwQhSqNK8bm] cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.</p><p>When you cast @UUID[Compendium.renegados-compendium.magias.Item.H0rSowwQhSqNK8bm], you can create both a sound and an image with a single casting of the spell.</p></div></div>",
