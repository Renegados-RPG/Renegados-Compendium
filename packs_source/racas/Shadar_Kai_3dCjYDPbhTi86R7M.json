Outside the glory of Arvandor, their favourite place was the feywildâ€”a realm of unbridled passion. It was to that place of splendors that elves fled after they were exiled from @deity[Corellon Larethian|Elven|MTF|Corellon's] presence for plotting with their god's rival, @deity[Lolth|Drow|MTF]. And it was there that they transformed from Fey creatures into Humanoids and lost their ability to shape-shift at will. Afterward, they often wept as they realized what they had lost, their sorrow made even deeper by the Feywild's influence. But in the Feywild, they also discovered the potential joys of being people of fixed forms, and they rediscovered hope once they renounced @deity[Lolth|Drow|MTF|Lolth's] treachery.</p><p>Most elves eventually spread from the Feywild to other worlds, as wanderlust and curiosity drove them to the far reaches of the multiverse. In those other worlds, elves developed the physical forms now associated with them. Because of their original mutable nature, each group of elves mystically took on characteristics of the environment with which they bonded, whether forests (@race[Elf (Wood)|PHB|wood elves]), fey crossings in the Material Plane (@race[Elf (High)|PHB|high elves]), the Underdark (@race[Elf (Drow)|PHB|drow]), the Shadowfell (@race[shadar-kai|MPMM]), the Feywild (@race[eladrin|MPMM]), or oceans (@race[sea elf|MPMM|sea elves]).</p><p>In some places, @deity[Corellon Larethian|Elven|MTF|Corellon] has passed from elves' memory, but the god's blood flows within them still, even if they know nothing of its source. That blood is what causes them to evolve after spending centuries connected to a particular environment, so it is only a matter of time before other kinds of elves emerge.</p></div></div></div></div>",
