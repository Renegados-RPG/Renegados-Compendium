You choose the size when you select this race.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Claws\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Claws.</span> You have claws that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals [[/damage 1d6]] + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Hold Breath\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Hold Breath.</span> You can hold your breath for up to 1 hour.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Natural Armor\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Natural Armor.</span> Your shell provides you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You can't wear light, medium, or heavy armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Nature's Intuition\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Nature's Intuition.</span> Thanks to your mystical connection to nature, you gain proficiency with one of the following skills of your choice: &amp;Reference[skill=AnimalHandling]{Animal Handling}, &amp;Reference[skill=Medicine], &amp;Reference[skill=Nature], &amp;Reference[skill=Perception], &amp;Reference[skill=Stealth], or &amp;Reference[skill=Survival].</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Shell Defense\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Shell Defense.</span> You can withdraw into your shell as an action. Until you emerge, you gain a +4 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in your shell, you are &amp;Reference[condition=prone], your speed is 0 and can't increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, you can't take reactions, and the only action you can take is a bonus action to emerge from your shell.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Languages\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.</p></div></div><hr class=\"hr-1\" /><p>Tortles have a saying: \"We wear our homes on our backs.\" These turtle folk live on many worlds, most often journeying up and down coasts, along waterways, and across the sea. Tortles don't have a unified story of how they were created, but they all have a sense of being mystically connected to the natural world. Carrying their shelter on their backs gives tortles a special feeling of security wherever they go, for even if they visit a far, unknown country, they have a place to lay their heads.</p><p>Tortles exhibit the same range of coloration and patterns found among turtles, and many tortles enjoy adorning their shells in distinctive ways.</p></div>",
