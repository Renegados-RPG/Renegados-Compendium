You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in a trancelike meditation, during which you retain consciousness.</p><p>Whenever you finish this trance, you can change your season, and you can gain two proficiencies that you don't have, each one with a weapon or a tool of your choice selected from the Player's Handbook. You mystically acquire these proficiencies by drawing them from shared elven memory, and you retain them until you finish your next long rest.</p>",
