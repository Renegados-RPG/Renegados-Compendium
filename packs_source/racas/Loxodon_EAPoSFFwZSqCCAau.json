They highly value the weight of wisdom and experience and are considered young until they reach the age of 60.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Alignment\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Alignment.</span> Most loxodons are lawful, believing in the value of a peaceful, ordered life. They also tend toward good.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Size\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Size.</span> Loxodons stand between 7 and 8 feet tall. Their massive bodies weigh between 300 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Powerful Build\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Powerful Build.</span> You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Loxodon Serenity\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Loxodon Serenity.</span> You have advantage on saving throws against being &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] or &amp;Reference[condition=frightened].</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Natural Armor\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Natural Armor.</span> You have thick, leathery skin. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Constitution modifier. You can use your natural armor to determine your AC if the armor you wear would leave you with a lower AC. A shield's benefits apply as normal while you use your natural armor.</p><div class=\"rd__b-special rd__b-inset\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Tip: AC Calculations Don't Stack\"><h4 class=\"entry-title-inner\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"7\">Tip: AC Calculations Don't Stack</span></h4><p>When the game gives you more than one way to calculate your Armor Class, you can use only one of them. You choose the one to use. For example, if you have the loxodon's Natural Armor trait and the monk's Unarmored Defense feature, you don't mix them together. Instead, you choose which one determines your AC.</p></div></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Trunk\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trunk.</span> You can grasp things with your trunk, and you can use it as a snorkel. It has a reach of 5 feet, and it can lift a number of pounds equal to five times your Strength score. You can use it to do the following simple tasks: lift, drop, hold, push, or pull an object or a creature; open or close a door or a container; grapple someone; or make an unarmed strike. Your DM might allow other simple tasks to be added to that list of options.</p><p>Your trunk can't wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision, such as using tools or magic items or performing the somatic components of a spell.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Keen Smell\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Keen Smell.</span> Thanks to your sensitive trunk, you have advantage on Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Perception]), Wisdom (&amp;Reference[skill=Survival]), and Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation]) checks that involve smell.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Languages\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Languages.</span> You can speak, read, and write Common and Loxodon.</p></div></div><hr class=\"hr-1\" /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lumbering Giants\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lumbering Giants.</span> Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin. Each of their hands has four thick digits, and their feet are the flat-bottomed, oval-shaped feet of elephants.</p><p>Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Gifted Stoneworkers\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Gifted Stoneworkers.</span> Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. Although they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild's magnificent, cathedral-like arboretum structures.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Relentlessly Loyal\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Relentlessly Loyal.</span> Loxodons believe in the value of community and life, and thus are most often found in the Selesnya Conclave. Some find fulfillment in the cause of order by joining the Orzhov Syndicate or the Azorius Senate.</p><p>Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond. They coordinate their efforts and are often willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the group. They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.</p><p>The primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to. For loxodons in the Selesnya Conclave, their community is the world and all living beings in it—everything valuable, meant to live in harmony, and interdependent. For Azorius loxodons, community primarily means a society of different peoples who need adherence to law and order so they can function together. For those in the Orzhov Syndicate, community means the syndicate alone, with its interests taking priority over those of any other group.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Loxodon Names\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Loxodon Names.</span> A loxodon's name includes subtle tones, produced in a loxodon's resonant nasal chambers, that indicate status, family connection, and community role. Since most non-loxodons can't distinguish these underlying tones, let alone produce them, loxodons often translate them into titles, such as Hierarch, Revered, Grandmother, Healer, or Saint, when interacting with other races.</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Male Names:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Male Names:</span> Bayul, Berov, Brooj, Chedumov, Dobrun, Droozh, Golomov, Heruj, Ilromov, Kel, Nikoom, Ondros, Radomov, Svetel, Tamuj, Throom, Vasool</p></li></ul><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Female Names:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Female Names:</span> Ajj, Boja, Dancu, Dooja, Elyuja, Fanoor, Irij, Jasoo, Katrun, Lyooda, Mayja, Radu, Shuja, Soofya, Totoor, Verij, Vesmova, Yoolna, Zarij, Zoorja</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>",
