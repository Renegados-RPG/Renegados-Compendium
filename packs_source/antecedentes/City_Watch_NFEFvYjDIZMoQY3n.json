You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.</p><p>You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep, the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors, protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.</p><p>Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded branch of guards who vow to keep safe the City of Skilled Hands.</p><p>Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background can describe your early years as a member of law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have their own constables and police forces, and even smaller communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready to protect their community.</p></div></div></div><hr /><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Skill Proficiencies:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Skill Proficiencies:</span> &amp;Reference[skill=Athletics], &amp;Reference[skill=Insight]</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Languages:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Languages:</span> Any two of your choice</p></li><li class=\"rd__li \"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Equipment:\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Equipment:</span> A uniform in the style of your unit and indicative of your rank, a @item[horn|phb] with which to summon help, a set of @item[manacles|phb], and a @item[pouch|phb] containing 10 gp</p></li></ul><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Feature: Watcher's Eye\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Feature: Watcher's Eye</span></h3><p>Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and criminals. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch or a similar organization, and just as easily pick out the dens of criminal activity in a community, although you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations rather than the latter.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Suggested Characteristics\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"2\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Suggested Characteristics</span></h3><p>Use the tables for the @background[soldier] background in the Player's Handbook as the basis for your traits and motivations, modifying the entries when appropriate to suit your identity as a member of the city watch.</p><p>Your bond is likely associated with your fellow watch members or the watch organization itself and almost certainly concerns your community. Your ideal probably involves the fostering of peace and safety. An investigator is likely to have an ideal connected to achieving justice by successfully solving crimes.</p></div></div></div>",
