The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects.</p><p>Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Corridors\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Corridors.</span></span> Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them &amp;Reference[rule=heavilyobscured]{heavily obscured}. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a [[/r 1d100]]{50 percent} chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Doors\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Doors.</span></span> All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an @spell[arcane lock] spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the @spell[minor illusion] spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Stairs\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"3\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Stairs.</span></span> Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the @spell[web] spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Other Spell Effect\" class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"4\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Other Spell Effect.</span></span> You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">Place @spell[dancing lights] in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Place @spell[magic mouth] in two locations.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Place @spell[stinking cloud] in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Place a constant @spell[gust of wind] in one corridor or room.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Place a @spell[suggestion] in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.</li></ul></div><p>The whole warded area radiates magic. A @spell[dispel magic] cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.</p><p>You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.</p></div>",
