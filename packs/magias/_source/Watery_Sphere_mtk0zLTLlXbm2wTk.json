      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You conjure up a sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spell's duration.</p><p>Any creature in the sphere's space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creature's choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the sphere and is engulfed by the water. At the end of each of its turns, a &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the sphere falls out of it and lands &amp;Reference[condition=prone] in a space within 5 feet of it.</p><p>As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.</p><p>When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the sphere is knocked &amp;Reference[condition=prone] in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.</p></div>",
