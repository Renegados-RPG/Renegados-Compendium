When you do so, choose one of the following armor models: Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.</p><p>Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to the attack and damage rolls.</p><p>You can change the armor's model whenever you finish a short or long rest, provided you have @item[smith's tools|PHB] in hand.</p><div class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\"><p></p><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Guardian\" class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Guardian.</span> You design your armor to be in the front line of conflict. It has the following features:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li\"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Thunder Gauntlets\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Thunder Gauntlets.</span> Each of the armor's gauntlets counts as a simple melee weapon while you aren't holding anything in it, and it deals [[/damage 1d8 type=thunder]] damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the creature attacks someone else.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Defensive Field\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Defensive Field.</span> As a bonus action, you can gain temporary hit points equal to your level in this class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p></li></ul></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Infiltrator\" class=\"rd__b rd__b--3\"><p><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Infiltrator.</span> You customize your armor for subtle undertakings. It has the following features:</p><ul class=\"rd__list rd__list-hang-notitle\"><li class=\"rd__li\"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Lightning Launcher\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Lightning Launcher.</span> A gemlike node appears on one of your armored fists or on the chest (your choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals [[/damage 1d6 type=lightning]] damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra [[/damage 1d6 type=lightning]] damage to that target.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Powered Steps\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Powered Steps.</span> Your walking speed increases by 5 feet.</p></li><li class=\"rd__li\"><p class=\"rd__p-list-item\" data-roll-name-ancestor=\"Dampening Field\"><span class=\"bold rd__list-item-name\">Dampening Field.</span> You have advantage on Dexterity (&amp;Reference[skill=Stealth]) checks. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div>",
